      "My wife, Debbie and I met Pearl P.J. Yuen, at one of the United Health Care seminars. We were very impressed with how personable, friendly and knowledgeable she was. She was very patient with our questions and concerns, and we were very amazed at how knowledgeable she was with all the different companies that offered supplemental Medicare coverage! She never made us feel ignorant or unimportant. Because of Pearl, we understood more about supplemental coverage, than we weren't confused, lol! We feel we cannot do without her... her wealth of knowledge and wisdom. Each and every year, she faithfully contacts us and checks on us to see if we need any help, and apprises us of any changes. You are very fortunate to have Pearl, she is a great asset to your company. We are fortunate to know her well!",

Upon graduating from the university in 2010, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do professionally and stumbled across the health insurance industry. I started working for Aflac doing supplemental health insurance for local businesses and while I held a number of different jobs while I was in school, brokering health insurance was my first job where I could build a career. As I progressed in my career, I started brokering full medical plans for companies as well as selling life insurance. I eventually joined FBI where, in addition to maintaining my current book of business, I am now able to help our Medicare beneficiaries with their health insurance needs. It was a natural progression to offer health insurance coverage not only for the people who worked at the companies I had a relationship with, but also when they went into retirement. In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, golfing, cooking, gardening, coaching and hanging out with my family."

      "When I reached retirement age, I had to negotiate the world of Medicare Insurance - they don’t teach you this in college.  I also needed to help a family member that had a disability find the best plan for him when he qualified for SSI.  After years of struggling to figure out what was best, I ran into my agent who also works for FBIHI  and she shared her knowledge with me.  She was so wonderful and took such good care of me, making sure that when the different companies plans changed that she had me on the best plan for my needs.  I was so grateful to her, that I decided that I wanted to do the same and help others who were struggling to understand.  I knew it was important to be with a good company that would keep me updated and educated and thus why I joined FBIHI.  I love what I do and I love helping others in being informed about the best way to go when it comes to their Medicare coverage."
