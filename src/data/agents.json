She’s been very successful in helping hundreds of her Medicare clients find better healthcare and retirement solutions and prides herself in being able to successfully help her Kupuna to navigate through the Medicare system and take the confusion out of their Medicare options.  If you were to ask her “Why Medicare Insurance” she would say because she understands how important it is to have proper coverage and access to healthcare when you need it!  It makes all the difference in the quality of your life when you know that you’re protected financially and have access to excellent care.  That’s what mattered to her as a caregiver for two of the most amazing and important women in her life, they meant the world to her.  The best insurance available is the insurance you have in place that fits YOUR needs when an emergency happens.  You… are your family’s most valuable asset, peace of mind for yourself and your family, that’s important.",

She will take whatever time is necessary to make sure she explains how Medicare works and solutions to help solve any issues her members may have.  She will take that time to listen to what her clients say, what they want, and what they need.  She will make sure everyone’s happy working together so that her clients and members are able to make well informed decisions about their healthcare choices; making sure she can help find the best fit for her clients and maximize benefits available to them.",

Anjeannette is married to George Leslie and they have a blended family of five children and seven grandchildren.  As a family they love the ocean and spend a lot of their time outdoors in the yard, at the beach or in our island forests.  She loves road trips, camping, painting, gardening and just enjoying life with her hubby and her family."

      "I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, where I attended Iolani High School. After graduating, I accepted an athletic scholarship to play soccer at the University of Washington in Seattle. Upon graduating from the university in 2010, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do professionally and stumbled across the health insurance industry. I started working for Aflac doing supplemental health insurance for local businesses and while I held a number of different jobs while I was in school, brokering health insurance was my first job where I could build a career. As I progressed in my career, I started brokering full medical plans for companies as well as selling life insurance. I eventually joined FBI where, in addition to maintaining my current book of business, I am now able to help our Medicare beneficiaries with their health insurance needs. It was a natural progression to offer health insurance coverage not only for the people who worked at the companies I had a relationship with, but also when they went into retirement. In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, golfing, cooking, gardening, coaching and hanging out with my family."

      "I am one of you, a Medicare Beneficiary. At age 71 years old I walk in your shoes.  I can relate to you. My father is 95 years old and my mother died two years ago at the age of 93. She was getting forgetful in her 70's and had signs of dementia in her 80's. She fell broke her hip and spent 3 weeks in a skilled nursing facility. Two years later she was gone. One of my regrets is taking away my father's drivers license when he was 86 years old. He was still working as taxi driver and worked the Airport-Waikiki route. In hindsight we took away his independence. At age 86 he was still golfing twice a week with his fellow taxi drivers. He was the old man on his golf club teams. Now at age 95 he has outlived all his childhood and close friends. This year after years of denial I finally got hearing aids. My wife is so happy. As we get older we know the importance of good health and spending time with family.",
      "After working 35 years at Sears in retail management, I retired in 2006. I passed the Hawaii State Licensing Exam and worked with my son, Travis, learning Medicare health insurance. Travis and I started Financial Benefits Insurance in 2010 with 3 agents. This year Financial Benefits Insurance is celebrating 10 years of growth, expansion, and innovation. We currently have 52 years and 3 offices (Honolulu, Hilo, and Waipahu). Most of my time is spent training our 52 agents on Medicare health plans and options. Travis and I do over 140 Medicare formal presentations very year. Yes, we know Medicare and love educating our Kupuna.",
      "After 50 years of marriage I finally run the house. I run the dishwasher, run the vacuum cleaner, and run the washer & dryer. We have 3 children, 10 grandkids, and 14 great grandkids. We spend more time with our grandkids than with our own children. Being empty nesters, Darlee and I love to travel and go on cruises. So far we went on 5 cruises and numerous vacation trips to the mainland. We not only enjoy visiting Europe, Scandinavia, Baltic countries, China and Japan but also learning different cultures and eating their food. We enjoy growing old with each other."
