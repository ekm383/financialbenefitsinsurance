And also, received an Accelerated Christian Education. While teaching Christian Education, I worked also as a Sales Associate for Insurance and different products. And in 1990, I moved to Hawaii and established the Fountain of Living Water Christian Mission, Inc. church. The passion of helping people most especially my fellow Filipinos leads me to self study and passed my Health Insurance License in 1997. Being fluent with Tagalog, Ilocano and English makes me easier to communicate and share the importance of having an Insurance. I love and enjoyed this job because I can meet new people and shares my passion in cooking too. Being an Insurance Agent, for 23 wonderful years, helps me a lot to extend my compassion of helping people regardless of any race and nationality."

She was getting forgetful in her 70's and had signs of dementia in her 80's. She fell broke her hip and spent 3 weeks in a skilled nursing facility. Two years later she was gone. One of my regrets is taking away my father's drivers license when he was 86 years old. He was still working as taxi driver and worked the Airport-Waikiki route. In hindsight we took away his independence. At age 86 he was still golfing twice a week with his fellow taxi drivers. He was the old man on his golf club teams. Now at age 96 he has outlived all his childhood and close friends. This year after years of denial I finally got hearing aids. My wife is so happy.

Upon graduating from the university in 2010, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do professionally and stumbled across the health insurance industry. I started working for Aflac doing supplemental health insurance for local businesses and while I held a number of different jobs while I was in school, brokering health insurance was my first job where I could build a career. As I progressed in my career, I started brokering full medical plans for companies as well as selling life insurance. I eventually joined FBI where, in addition to maintaining my current book of business, I am now able to help our Medicare beneficiaries with their health insurance needs. It was a natural progression to offer health insurance coverage not only for the people who worked at the companies I had a relationship with, but also when they went into retirement.

      "Anjeannette Wahinekapu grew up in Kailua Kona Hawaii; she spent part of her life in Tampa Florida before returning to the islands as the eldest sibling to help take care of her grandmother and her mother.  She started her insurance career in 2017 as a broker and has been a Public Benefits Coordinator with Financial Benefits Insurance since December 2018.  She’s been very successful in helping hundreds of her Medicare clients find better healthcare and retirement solutions and prides herself in being able to successfully help her Kupuna to navigate through the Medicare system and take the confusion out of their Medicare options.  If you were to ask her “Why Medicare Insurance” she would say because she understands how important it is to have proper coverage and access to healthcare when you need it!  It makes all the difference in the quality of your life when you know that you’re protected financially and have access to excellent care.  That’s what mattered to her as a caregiver for two of the most amazing and important women in her life, they meant the world to her.  The best insurance available is the insurance you have in place that fits YOUR needs when an emergency happens.  You… are your family’s most valuable asset, peace of mind for yourself and your family, that’s important.",
      "Anjeannette’s most common compliment has been her Aloha Spirit, how welcoming and approachable she is and how comfortable her members feel working together with her.  She will take whatever time is necessary to make sure she explains how Medicare works and solutions to help solve any issues her members may have.  She will take that time to listen to what her clients say, what they want, and what they need.  She will make sure everyone’s happy working together so that her clients and members are able to make well informed decisions about their healthcare choices; making sure she can help find the best fit for her clients and maximize benefits available to them.",
      "Anjeannette loves art; she spends a lot of her spare time painting with her children and grandchildren.  When she isn’t working you can find her time spent with her family.  Anjeannette is married to George Leslie and they have a blended family of five children and seven grandchildren.  As a family they love the ocean and spend a lot of their time outdoors in the yard, at the beach or in our island forests.  She loves road trips, camping, painting, gardening and just enjoying life with her hubby and her family."

      "I was born in Tucson, Arizona. I originally fell in love with Vegas when I moved here at age 14 to live with my father after my parents got divorced. At age 16, I went to North Carolina to visit my mom and ended up staying there. Shortly after graduating from UNC Greensboro with a BS in Business Administration, I moved to Atlanta, Georgia to spread my wings in a 'big city'. After 3 years of self-discovery, I decided it was time to move back to Vegas to live closer to my father and be back in a city I love.",
      "Las Vegas has so much to offer. I love being a tourist in my own city. From the lights, entertainment, gambling, energy, and of course a great selection of food choices (Yes, I love the buffets). For those of you that have been here, you also know that Vegas has some absolutely amazing scenery, some great sunsets, and tons of outdoor activities. There is definitely no shortage golf courses, hiking trails, camp sites, or lake activities.",
      "In 2014, I was encouraged to obtain my Life and Health insurance licenses', and have not regretted it for a moment. I enjoy helping people make decisions about what insurance will be the best choice for them. My father has been sick for the past 10+ years, so I know how vital it is to have healthcare that fits every individual's needs. "
